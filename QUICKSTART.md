## ‚ö° Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Create Icons (5 minutes)

You need 3 icon files. Quickest option:

**Option A: Use an Online Generator**
1. Go to [favicon.io/favicon-generator](https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/)
2. Settings:
   - Text: "BB" or "üß†"
   - Background: Rounded, Purple (#6366f1)
   - Font: Bold
3. Download and extract
4. Create `/icons/` folder
5. Rename files:
   - `android-chrome-192x192.png` ‚Üí `icon128.png`
   - Resize copies to 48x48 and 16x16
6. Place in `/icons/` folder

**Option B: Use Emoji (30 seconds)**
1. Screenshot the üß† emoji at different sizes
2. Crop to square
3. Save as `icon16.png`, `icon48.png`, `icon128.png`
4. Place in `/icons/` folder

**Option C: Skip for Now**
- Extension works without icons (shows default puzzle piece)
- Add them before submission

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Extension Won't Load
- **Error: "Manifest file is missing or unreadable"**
  - Check that `manifest.json` exists
  - Verify JSON syntax (no trailing commas)

- **Error: "Service worker registration failed"**
  - Check that `background.js` exists
  - Look for syntax errors in console

### No Captures Appearing
1. Check service worker is running:
   - Go to: `chrome://extensions/`
   - Find BrowseBack
   - Click: "service worker" link
   - Look for: "BrowseBack: Initialized successfully"

2. Check permissions:
   - Extension should have "activeTab" and "tabs" permissions
   - Grant if prompted

3. Check console for errors:
   - Right-click extension icon
   - Select: "Inspect popup"
   - Check Console tab

### Search Not Working
- **Check IndexedDB:**
  - Right-click extension icon ‚Üí Inspect popup
  - Go to: Application tab ‚Üí IndexedDB ‚Üí BrowseBackDB
  - Should see "captures" object store
  - Should have data if captures were made

- **Clear and retry:**
  - Open Settings in extension
  - Click "Delete All Captures"
  - Make fresh captures
  - Try search again

### Prompt API Not Available
- **Check flag status:**
  - `chrome://flags/#prompt-api-for-gemini-nano` must be "Enabled"
  - Chrome must be restarted after enabling

- **Check enrollment:**
  - Ensure you signed up for Early Preview Program
  - May take 24 hours for some users

- **Fallback works anyway:**
  - Extension uses DOM text extraction as fallback
  - OCR is enhancement, not requirement
  - Search will still work on visible text
