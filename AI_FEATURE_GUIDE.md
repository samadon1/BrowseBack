# ü§ñ AI Answer Feature - Guide

## What We Added

**"Ask AI" - Natural Language Answers from Your Browsing History**

Using Chrome's Prompt API (Gemini Nano), BrowseBack can now generate intelligent answers to your questions based on your captured browsing history.

## ‚ú® Features

### 1. **AI Answer Button**
- ü§ñ Button next to search bar

User: "What were those React hooks I was reading about?"

AI: "Based on your browsing history, you visited the official React
documentation about Hooks on react.dev. The main hooks discussed were
useState for state management and useEffect for side effects like data
fetching. You also viewed a tutorial on useMemo for performance
optimization."
```

### 3. **Source Citations**
- Lists the top 5 pages used to generate the answer
- Clickable source cards
- Shows page title and URL

### 4. **Beautiful UI**
- Gradient purple/pink answer card
- "Powered by Chrome Built-in AI" badge
- Smooth animations
- Easy to close and return to results

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Architecture

```
User Query
    ‚Üì
1. Search browsing history (keyword search)
    ‚Üì
2. Get top 5 most relevant captures
    ‚Üì
3. Extract text from those captures (500 chars each)
    ‚Üì
4. Build context prompt for AI
    ‚Üì
5. Send to Chrome Prompt API (Gemini Nano)
    ‚Üì
6. AI generates answer based on context
    ‚Üì
7. Display answer + sources
```

### Prompt Template

```javascript
const prompt = `Based on this browsing history:

[1] Page Title (url)
Page content excerpt...

[2] Another Page (url)
More content...

User Question: ${query}

Answer:`;
```

### API Usage

```javascript
// Initialize session
const aiSession = await window.ai.languageModel.create({
  systemPrompt: `You are a helpful assistant that answers
  questions based on the user's browsing history.`
});

// Generate answer
const answer = await aiSession.prompt(contextPrompt);
```

## üé¨ Demo Script

Perfect for showing in your hackathon video!

### Script:

**1. Show Regular Search (10s)**
```
"Here's normal search... it shows a list of pages.
But what if you could just ASK a question?"
```

**2. Type Question (5s)**
```
Type: "What were the main features of that Chrome extension I looked at?"
```

**3. Click Ask AI (5s)**
```
"Watch this... [Click ü§ñ button]"
"AI is analyzing your browsing history..."
```

**4. Show Answer (20s)**
```
[AI answer appears]

"BrowseBack uses Chrome's built-in AI - Gemini Nano -
to actually ANSWER your question from your history.

Not just showing results... giving you the information.

And look - it cites sources, so you can verify and dig deeper."
```

**5. Emphasize Local (10s)**
```
"Best part? This all happens locally on your device.
No cloud. No servers. 100% private.

Chrome's built-in AI makes this possible."
```

## üí° Use Cases

### 1. **Remember Specific Information**

- "How do I center a div in CSS?"
- "What was that GitHub repo about?"

### 2. **Recall Context**

- "Summarize the articles I read about AI"
- "What were the key points from that tutorial?"

### 3. **Find Lost Information**
- "Where did I see that blue diagram?"
- "What was the name of that VS Code extension?"

- Show source citations
- Highlight the "wow factor"

**Key Points:**
- ‚úÖ Uses Prompt API (required for hackathon)
- ‚úÖ Multimodal capability (processes text from images)
- ‚úÖ Local AI (privacy-first)
- ‚úÖ Practical use case (actually helpful!)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### AI Button Disabled?

**Reason:** Prompt API not available yet

**Check:**
1. Enrolled in Early Preview Program?
2. Flags enabled?
   - `chrome://flags/#optimization-guide-on-device-model`
   - `chrome://flags/#prompt-api-for-gemini-nano`
3. Chrome restarted after enabling flags?

**Fallback:**
- Regular search still works perfectly
- AI feature is enhancement, not requirement

### "Prompt API may not be fully available" Error?

This is normal! The Prompt API is in early preview.

**For Demo:**
- Mention it's "early access technology"
- Show that it works when available
- Emphasize the architecture is ready

**Judges will understand** - they know it's new technology!

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

### With More API Availability:

**1. Summarizer API Integration**
```javascript
const summarizer = await window.ai.summarizer.create();
const summary = await summarizer.summarize(longPageContent);
```

**Use:** Daily digest of browsing activity

**2. Translator API**
```javascript
const translator = await window.ai.translator.create({
  sourceLanguage: 'en',
  targetLanguage: 'es'
});
```

**Use:** Search across multilingual content

**3. Multi-Turn Conversations**
```
User: "What was that React article?"
AI: "You read about React Hooks..."
User: "Tell me more about useState"
AI: "useState is a hook that..."
```

---

## üìä Comparison

### Before (Just Keyword Search)
```
Query: "react hooks"
Result: [List of 10 pages with "react" and "hooks"]
User: *Clicks through each page to find answer*
```

### After (With AI Answer)
```
Query: "what are react hooks"
Result: "React Hooks are functions that let you use state
and other React features in functional components. Based
on your history, you viewed documentation about useState,
useEffect, and useContext..."

User: *Gets answer immediately* ‚úÖ
```
