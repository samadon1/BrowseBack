## 🎯 The Problem

- **Users forget** where they saw information online
- **Browser history** is just a list of URLs (not searchable by content)
- **Can't remember context**: "What was I researching Tuesday afternoon?"
- **Screenshots/bookmarks** require manual effort (and people forget)

## ✨ The Solution

BrowseBack runs silently in the background, automatically:

- 📸 **Capturing screenshots** of your active tab
- 🔤 **Extracting text** using OCR powered by Chrome Prompt API
- 🔍 **Building a searchable local index** of all content
- 🧠 **Letting you search** by content, time, or natural language

## 🔒 Privacy First

- ✅ **100% local processing** - your browsing data never leaves your device
- ✅ **Works completely offline** - no internet required for search
- ✅ **Zero subscription fees** - no cloud costs
- ✅ **You own your data** - export or delete anytime

## 👥 Use Cases

BrowseBack is perfect for anyone who needs to recall what they've seen online:

- **🎓 Students** - Find lecture notes, research papers, and study materials you've browsed
- **💼 Executives** - Recall details from market research, competitor analysis, and reports
- **👨‍💻 Engineers** - Quickly find API docs, Stack Overflow solutions, and technical articles
- **💰 Sales Teams** - Remember product details, customer research, and competitive intel
- **🧠 People with ADHD** - Never lose track of important information in your browsing sessions
- **🔬 Researchers** - Track down sources and references you encountered during your work
- **📝 Content Creators** - Find inspiration and reference materials from your browsing history

   - Enable flags:
     - `chrome://flags/#optimization-guide-on-device-model`
     - `chrome://flags/#prompt-api-for-gemini-nano`

### Install the Extension

1. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/browseback.git
   cd browseback
   ```

2. **Load in Chrome**
   - Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in top right)
   - Click **Load unpacked**
   - Select the `BrowseBack` folder

3. **Grant Permissions**
   - Click on the BrowseBack icon in your toolbar

   - Click **"Download AI Components"** to start downloading Gemini Nano
   - The download is ~1.5GB and may take several minutes
   - You can track progress in the extension popup
   - **Note**: Models download once and are shared across all Chrome AI apps

5. **Start Browsing!**
   - Once AI models are ready, BrowseBack starts capturing automatically
   - Click the extension icon anytime to search your memory
   - Use Timeline, Search, or Ask modes to find what you need

> 💡 **Tip**: For detailed AI setup instructions, see the [AI Setup Guide](docs/AI_SETUP_GUIDE.md)

## 🎮 Usage

### Automatic Capture

- BrowseBack captures your active tab every **10 seconds** (configurable)
- Only captures when tab content changes (saves storage)
- Skips internal Chrome pages (`chrome://`, `edge://`, etc.)

### Search Your Memory

1. Click the BrowseBack icon in your toolbar
2. Type your search query:
   - **Content search**: "Python tutorial" finds pages with that text
   - **Time-based**: Click "Today" or "Yesterday" chips
   - **URL search**: Search by domain or path
   - **Blank search**: Shows recent captures

### Privacy Dashboard

- View total captures and storage used
- Adjust capture interval (5s to 1 minute)
- Set data retention period (3 days to 1 year)
- Delete all data with one click

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
BrowseBack/
├── manifest.json           # Chrome extension configuration
├── background.js          # Service worker (automatic capture)
├── content.js             # Content script (DOM text extraction)
├── lib/
│   ├── storage.js        # IndexedDB wrapper
│   ├── capture.js        # Screenshot capture logic
│   └── ai-processor.js   # Chrome Prompt API integration
└── popup/

```

### Technologies Used

- **Chrome Extension Manifest V3**
- **Google Gemini Nano** - On-device AI model powering all intelligent features
- **Chrome Prompt API (LanguageModel)** - AI question answering, transcription, and summarization
- **Chrome Proofreader API** - Query correction and spell checking
- **Chrome Speech Recognition API** - Real-time audio capture from tabs
- **IndexedDB** - Local storage for captures and transcripts
- **WebP compression** - Efficient screenshot storage
- **Service Workers** - Background processing and capture automation

---

## 🎓 How It Works

1. **Capture**: Background service worker monitors active tab
2. **Change Detection**: Only captures when content changes significantly
3. **Screenshot**: Uses `chrome.tabs.captureVisibleTab()` API
4. **Text Extraction**:
   - Primary: DOM text extraction (fast, accurate)
   - Secondary: OCR via Prompt API (images, videos)
5. **Storage**: Saves to IndexedDB with metadata (URL, title, timestamp)
6. **Search**: Full-text search across all stored content
7. **Cleanup**: Automatically deletes old data based on retention settings

## 🏆 Google Chrome Built-in AI Challenge 2025

### Problem Solved

BrowseBack solves the universal problem of **digital forgetfulness**. Users spend hours re-searching for information they've already seen. Our solution:

- **Unlocks photographic memory** for everyone
- **Privacy-first** approach (no cloud, no tracking)
- **Zero friction** (automatic, passive capture)
- **Universal use case** (students, researchers, developers, anyone)

### Differentiator

Unlike cloud-based solutions, BrowseBack is:

- ✅ **100% free** (no server costs)
- ✅ **100% private** (local-only processing)
- ✅ **100% offline** (network-resilient)

## 💡 FAQ

**Q: Does BrowseBack slow down my browser?**
A: No. Captures happen asynchronously and don't block tab rendering.

**Q: Can I use this on mobile?**
A: Not yet. Chrome extensions don't support mobile, but we're exploring Firebase AI.

**Q: What happens if I run out of storage?**
A: BrowseBack automatically deletes old captures based on your retention settings.

**Q: Can I export my data?**
A: Yes! Use the browser's IndexedDB export tools, or we'll add a built-in export feature soon.

**Q: Is this really private?**
A: Absolutely. All data stays in IndexedDB on your device. No network requests, no telemetry.
