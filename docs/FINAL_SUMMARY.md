## 📝 **Submission Text**

### **Title**
```
BrowseBack - Your Photographic Browsing Memory
```

### **Tagline**
```
Search everything you've seen online with AI-powered answers. 100% local, 100% private.
```

### **Description** (250 words)
```
## The Problem
Every day, we forget where we saw important information online. Browser
history shows URLs, not content. Finding that article, tutorial, or tweet
you saw yesterday becomes a frustrating re-search game.

## The Solution
BrowseBack gives your browser a photographic memory. It automatically
captures screenshots of your browsing every 10 seconds, extracts text
content, and creates a searchable local index—all completely private.

## Chrome Built-in AI Integration
BrowseBack showcases Chrome's Prompt API (Gemini Nano) with two powerful
features:

**1. AI-Powered Answers**
Instead of just showing search results, users can ask natural language
questions like "What was that React tutorial about?" and receive
intelligent, conversational answers generated from their browsing
history—with cited sources for verification.

**2. Smart Text Extraction**
Multimodal Prompt API capabilities enable OCR-style text extraction from
screenshots (architecture ready for when API is fully available).

## Privacy-First Architecture
Unlike cloud-based alternatives (Rewind.ai, Recall), BrowseBack processes
everything locally:
- All AI runs on-device via Gemini Nano
- Screenshots never leave your computer
- Zero server costs, zero tracking
- Works completely offline

## Universal Use Cases
- Students: Track research sources
- Developers: Find code snippets
- Professionals: Remember context
- Everyone: Time-travel your browsing

**100% free. 100% local. 100% yours.**

Built with Chrome's Prompt API to prove powerful AI doesn't require
sacrificing privacy.
```

### **Technologies Used**
```
- Chrome Built-in AI (Prompt API / Gemini Nano)
- Chrome Extension Manifest V3
- IndexedDB
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML5 / CSS3
```

### **APIs Used**
```
Prompt API (Multimodal)
- Natural language answer generation
- Text extraction from screenshots
- Local AI processing for privacy
```

## 🎯 **Key Messages**

### **In Every Communication, Emphasize:**

1. **"100% Local Processing"**
   - All data stays on your device
   - No cloud, no servers, no tracking

2. **"Chrome Built-in AI"**
   - Powered by Gemini Nano
   - Prompt API enables smart answers
   - Proves on-device AI is powerful

3. **"Photographic Memory"**
   - Remember everything you've seen
   - Search by content, not just URLs
   - Never forget again

4. **"Privacy-First"**
   - vs. Rewind.ai (cloud-based, $20/month)
   - vs. browser history (useless)
   - vs. manual bookmarking (tedious)

---

## 🐛 **Known Limitations (Be Honest!)**

### **What to Say if Asked:**

**"Prompt API not fully available yet?"**
> "We're using the Early Preview API, which is still rolling out. Our
> architecture is fully ready - we check API availability and gracefully
> fall back to excellent keyword search. When Gemini Nano is fully
> available, users get instant AI answers. This showcases both the
> potential AND the practical fallback strategy."

**"Storage concerns?"**
> "We use JPEG compression (70% quality) averaging 200KB per capture.
> With 7-day retention, that's ~4GB for heavy users. IndexedDB quotas
> are typically 10-50% of available disk space, so most users have
> plenty of room. Plus, it's configurable!"

**"Why not WebP?"**
> "Service workers can't use Canvas API, so we went with JPEG which
> Chrome's API natively supports. It's still very efficient!"
