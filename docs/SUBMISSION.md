# BrowseBack - Your Photographic Browsing Memory

## Problem Statement
Every day, users forget where they saw important information online. Browser history only shows URLs, not content. Finding that article, tutorial, or tweet you saw yesterday becomes a frustrating search game.

## Solution
BrowseBack gives your browser a photographic memory. It automatically captures screenshots of your browsing every 10 seconds, extracts text using Chrome's built-in AI, and creates a searchable index‚Äîall locally on your device.

## Chrome Built-in AI APIs Used

1. **Prompt API (Multimodal)**
   - Primary use: OCR text extraction from screenshots
   - Enables searching by visual content, not just URLs
   - Processes images locally for complete privacy

2. **Future Integration** (Planned):
   - Summarizer API: Daily digests of browsing activity
   - Translator API: Search across multilingual content
   - Writer API: Smart query suggestions

## Key Features

- üß† Automatic capture every 10 seconds
- üîç Full-text search across all captures
- üîí 100% local processing (no cloud, no tracking)
- ‚ö° Works completely offline
- üíæ Smart storage management
- üéØ Privacy-first architecture

## Technology Stack

- Chrome Extension Manifest V3
- Chrome Prompt API for on-device AI
- IndexedDB for local storage
- WebP compression for efficiency
- Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)

## Differentiators

Unlike cloud-based solutions (Rewind.ai, Recall):
- ‚úÖ Free forever (no server costs)
- ‚úÖ Completely private (local-only)
- ‚úÖ Network resilient (offline capable)
- ‚úÖ User owns their data (export anytime)

## Impact

**Universal Use Cases:**
- Students: Never lose research materials
- Developers: Find code snippets you've seen
- Researchers: Track information sources
- Everyone: Remember what you browsed Tuesday afternoon

**Scalability:**
Works for any user, any region, any language. No infrastructure required.

## Built With Privacy

All data stays on your device. No API keys, no cloud sync, no telemetry. The AI runs locally using Chrome's built-in models.
