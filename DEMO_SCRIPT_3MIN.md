# BrowseBack - 3 Minute Demo Script

## Intro: What is BrowseBack? (30 seconds)
"BrowseBack is a Chrome extension that automatically captures everything you browse. It indexes the visual content and text using AI, creating a searchable timeline of your entire browsing history. Everything runs locally on your device using Gemini Nano, so your data never leaves your machine.

This has use cases for students, execs, engineers, sales teams, and people with ADHD—anyone who needs perfect recall of what they've seen online."

## Demo Part 1: Timeline View (30 seconds)
"Let me show you how it works. Here's my browsing timeline from today. Every page I visited, automatically captured. I can scroll through and see everything chronologically.

Notice the performance indicator here—'45 tokens/sec'—that's Gemini Nano running locally on my CPU, processing everything in real-time. No cloud, no servers, just your device."

## Demo Part 2: Search Mode (40 seconds)
"Now, in Search mode, I can search through all the indexed data. Let's say I'm looking for something about 'robot locomotion.'

See? It instantly finds the exact page with the highlighted text. BrowseBack doesn't just search URLs and page titles—it searches the actual content, the DOM text, everything visible on the page.

For a medical student reviewing lectures, an engineer looking for a specific API doc, or a salesperson recalling a product detail—this is perfect."

## Demo Part 3: Ask Mode (50 seconds)
"But here's where it gets really powerful. In Ask mode, I can actually talk to my browsing history.

Instead of keywords, I ask natural questions like: 'What are the main types of robot locomotion?'

Watch—BrowseBack uses Gemini Nano to understand my question, searches through all my captures, and gives me an AI-generated answer based on what I actually browsed. It shows me the sources right here, so I can verify everything.

This is the difference between searching and understanding. The AI does the heavy lifting for you."

## Demo Part 4: Transcription Feature (50 seconds)
"Next, BrowseBack can transcribe videos—including meetings, interviews, lectures, anything with audio.

I hit 'Transcribe,' and it uses Chrome's Speech Recognition API to transcribe in real-time, completely local. Watch the text appear as the video plays.

When it's done, I can ask follow-up questions right here: 'What were the key points?' 'Create study notes.' 'Make flashcards.'

And here's the best part—I can save this transcript, go back to Ask mode, and talk to it just like any other content. It becomes part of my searchable timeline. So if I transcribed a lecture last week, I can ask questions about it today."

## Closing: Why This Matters (20 seconds)
"Everything you've seen—the screenshots, the AI indexing, the transcription, the question answering—all happens on your device. Nothing leaves your machine.

BrowseBack is your external memory. Perfect recall, powered by on-device AI."
