## 📝 Submission Text (Draft)

### Title
**BrowseBack - Your Photographic Browsing Memory**

### Tagline
**Search everything you've seen online. 100% local, 100% private.**

### Description (250 words)

Every day, we forget where we saw important information online. Browser history shows URLs, not content. Finding that article you read yesterday becomes a frustrating search game.

**BrowseBack solves this permanently.**

It automatically captures screenshots of your browsing every 10 seconds, extracts text using Chrome's built-in AI (Prompt API), and creates a searchable index—all locally on your device.

**Search by content, not just URLs.**
Type "Python tutorial" and find every page with that phrase. Filter by time: "What was I reading Tuesday afternoon?" Click any result to revisit the original page.

**Built with Chrome's Prompt API (Gemini Nano):**
- Multimodal OCR extracts text from screenshots
- Local AI processing (zero cloud costs)
- Privacy-first architecture (data never leaves device)

**Why this matters:**
Unlike cloud-based alternatives (Rewind.ai, Recall), BrowseBack is free, private, and offline-capable. It demonstrates exactly why Chrome's built-in AI is revolutionary: powerful features without sacrificing privacy.

**Universal use cases:**
- Students: Never lose research sources
- Developers: Find code snippets instantly
- Professionals: Remember context
- Everyone: Time-travel your browsing

**Technical highlights:**
- Manifest V3 Chrome Extension
- IndexedDB local storage
- WebP compression (efficient)
- Smart change detection
- Automatic cleanup

100% free. 100% local. 100% yours.
